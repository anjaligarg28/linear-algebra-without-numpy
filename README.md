# linear-algebra-without-numpy
A python script that contains almost all the functions provided by numpy.linalg module, built from scratch

# How to run on localhost:
Install Python
run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
run 'streamlit run streamlit_matrix_app.py'

# linear_algebra.py info:
This script contains functions to check matrix type like is_singular, is_symmetric etc
It also contains functions to calculate:
- determinant using recursion
- determinant using lower and upper decomposition of a matrix
- inverse of a matrix using cofactors approach
- qr decomposition using gram schmidt process
and many more..
